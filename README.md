# BF_Data_Analytics
Coursework from IBM and Google Data Analytics courses
Not sure why IBM would have us build a Git before we have any content really to place here.  Also I found the first 2 weeks (which only took a day) painful as far as IBM sales-y ness.  Just chill out.. if your stuff is awesome (and it should be -- how long was watson around before anyone even started saying "AI" ??!!). Anyhow - late + tired = byeeee!
